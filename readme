Function description:
This system is not based on their own training process.
We developed an platform based system for customer to set up their own training systems.
So what you should do when you first logon this system is:

1.you should create courses.
2.the training unit is course, some courses make steps and some steps make an workflow.

eg. If you would like to set up a React based application development.
Then you could set up courses like : 1.react 2.redux 3.node.js 4. Mongoldb
Then create a step called front end with 1. React 2.redux 
 Create another step called backend with 3.node.js 4.MongoDB

Then create a workflow with both front end and backend called Build a Simple React Application.

We also have a admin process.
We have 4 roles in this system.
Admin: set up the whole training system
For other users:
Pilot->Inspector->Auditpersong
When a student finished a training workflow, His Inspector would be informed at the notification panel.
Also, After inspecting, His Audit manager would be informed and the Audit Manager is the last person who have authorizaiton to decide whether this training succeed or failed.
